## Feature Toggles

Configuration options in `config.yaml` include a `features` section controlling core capabilities. Each feature can be enabled or disabled by setting `enabled` to `true` or `false`.

- **plugins** – load external Python plugins.
- **text_to_speech** – generate speech from text.
- **browser_automation** – run scripted browser interactions.
