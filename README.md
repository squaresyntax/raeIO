## Installation

### Linux / macOS

1. Make the script executable if necessary: `chmod +x install.sh`.
2. Run `./install.sh` and follow the prompts. The script detects your OS,
   installs Python 3, required pip packages, and downloads Playwright
   browser binaries.

### Windows

1. Double-click `install.bat` or run it from a command prompt.
   It verifies that Python 3 is installed, installs pip packages and
   executes `playwright install`.

Both scripts attempt to download a free font (Share Tech Mono) and provide
clear error messages if required system tools like `apt` or Homebrew are
missing.

## Quickstart

1. `streamlit run ui.py`
2. [Optional] Use PyInstaller or Briefcase for desktop app.
3. For mobile, open the app in your browser and "Add to Homescreen".
