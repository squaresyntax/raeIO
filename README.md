## Safety Filters and Legal Considerations

The project includes several safety mechanisms such as PII redaction, NSFW content checks, and action whitelisting.
These safeguards are enabled by default (`enable_pii_filter`, `enable_nsfw_filter`, `enforce_action_whitelist` set to `true`) to help prevent misuse and comply with applicable laws and platform policies.

You may disable these filters through the `safety_filters` and `security` sections of `config.yaml`, but doing so may expose you to legal liabilities and ethical concerns.
Users are solely responsible for any content generated or actions performed when safeguards are disabled.
